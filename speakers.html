                <h3>Taufiq Qureshi</h3>
                <h4>Percussionist, Composer, Artiste</h4>
                <hr />
                Taufiq Qureshi, an ace percussionist of India, referred to as
                a game changer, is also an acclaimed composer. Taufiq is
                recognized for his path-breaking and trend-setting work, as a
                performing artiste and as composer/arranger in the field of
                world music. Taufiq has been ably successful at taking the
                nuances of traditional rhythms of India to an alternate form
                of world music and offering it to a larger audience,
                comprising all age groups and from different parts of the
                world. Taufiq has pioneered and developed a distinct technique
                of playing the African percussion instrument, Djembe, in the
                context of Indian rhythmic compositions. Taufiq's album
                Rhydhun, amongst others, is said to be a benchmark for world
                music in India way back in the year 2000. Taufiq has been
                featured as a performing artiste in the 2009 Grammy-award
                winning album, 'Global Drum Project'. Taufiq's albums have
                been released world over and he has performed at prestigious
                Music festivals all over the globe. He has been a recipient of
                the Gold Award for Best Music at the Cannes Ad Film Festival
                and at the London International Festival for some of his
                exemplary advertisement ventures. Taufiq has lent a third
                dimension to many chartbuster songs and background score
                tracks of the Indian film industry genre of music, by virtue
                of his inimitable sense of rhythm arrangement and feel for
                sound. This exceptionally versatile percussionist, is the
                worthy torchbearer of a rich legacy of percussion, being the
                son and disciple of the legendary Ustad Allarakha and brother
                of the maestro Ustad Zakir Hussain by whom he has been greatly
                influenced. Taufiq has been fortunate to have received
                guidance from Ghatam Vidhwan, Pandit Vikku Vinayakram. Over
                the last fifteen years, he has been imparting training to
                deserving students, some of whom are now making their mark and
                carrying forward his work.

                <h4>Mountaineer, Humanitarian, Survivor</h4>
                <hr />
                For Kuntal Joisher, his whole life played out before him when
                he, along with other mountaineers, was trapped at Camp 2 of
                Mt. Everest during the devastating avalanche that swept
                through the encampment triggered by a massive Earthquake in
                April, 2015. The near death experience triggered in him a
                storm of emotions which would change his entire life.He is the
                first Indian Vegan mountaineer, hailing from Mumbai, India.
                Kuntal, a passionate climber, is as adventurous, dauntless and
                a risk-taker as they come but there’s more to him than meets
                the eye. His expeditions to some of the world’s most dangerous
                mountains are fiercely driven by a profound personal mission
                as a Vegan champion, Dementia awareness advocate and a
                Humanitarian inspiration.
